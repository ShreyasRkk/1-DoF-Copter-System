# 1-DoF-Copter-System
About This project presents the design, implementation, and analysis of a modified PID controller to stabilize the angular position of a 1-DOF copter system. The control algorithm was implemented on the ESP32 microcontroller. The controller performed well within the linear operating region of ±30°.
